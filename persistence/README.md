# Persistence

This directory contains the implementations of the user-level persistence techniques evaluated in the bachelor’s thesis.

The following techniques are implemented:

- Registry Run Key
- Startup Folder
- Scheduled Task (daily trigger)

These were applied to payloads that had already successfully evaded detection to analyze whether persistence mechanisms themselves influence Windows Defender’s detection behavior.
