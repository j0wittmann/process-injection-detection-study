# process-injection-detection-study

Repository for my bachelor’s thesis.

This project analyzes the detection behavior of Microsoft Windows Defender in response to Sliver-based command-and-control (C2) agents. It evaluates how payload generation, process injection, execution, and user-level persistence techniques influence static and dynamic detection mechanisms.

All experiments were conducted in a controlled laboratory environment.
